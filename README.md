A GUI-based Python tool to rename episode files with:

- Checkboxes to select/unselect files
- Clean output like: `ep05_part02.mp4`

## ðŸ§° How to Use (Python Version)

1. Install Python 3.10+
2. Save this file as `episode_renamer.py`
3. Run with:
   ```bash
   python episode_renamer.py

## ðŸ’¾ How to Use as .EXE (No Python Required on Target PC)

To run on Windows without needing Python:

1. Install [Python](https://python.org) and then install PyInstaller:
pip install pyinstaller


2. Save this file as `episode_renamer.py` on your computer.

3. Open **Command Prompt** in that folder and run:
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed episode_renamer.py
